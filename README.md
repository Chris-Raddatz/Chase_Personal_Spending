# Chase_Personal_Spending
Chase allows users to download their spending through csv format. I took my spending across 2022 - 2024 and performed analysis through Excel, utilizing Power Query and Pivot Tables, before exporting the file to R for some exploratory data analysis. I then created a dashboard on [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/chris.raddatz/viz/ChaseSpending_17178852164460/Dashboard).
